    <li>1992 - Manuel drank his first cup of coffee. It was a cold stormy day, and the cup breathed in desperately needed life. His life would never be the same.</li>
    <li>1996 - Manuel passes his Q-grader exam, becoming a certified coffee grader.</li>
    <li>1998 - Manuel begins teaching farmers about processing coffee. He also encounters Robusta and learns about it's advantages over Arabica that make it a more durable plant.</li>
    <li>2001 - As climate change sets in, Dr. Manuel takes note and begins to push farmers to grow more Robusta, and practice higher quality processing methods to achieve the best possible cup</li>
    <li>2006 - The first specialty grade Robusta coffee is cupped. Now that it has been proven to be a success, Manuel begins pushing more and more farmers to switch from Arabica to specialty Robusta.</li>
    <li>2012 - Specialty Robusta has become a household term and Arabica coffee no longer holds the dominance that it once did. Manuel has saved the coffee industry.</li>
